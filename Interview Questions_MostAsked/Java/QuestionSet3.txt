Interviewer: What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions in Java?

Me (as interviewee):
Great question! In Java, exceptions are divided into Checked and Unchecked exceptions based on how the compiler enforces handling them.

Checked Exceptions:
Definition:
These are exceptions that the compiler forces you to handle explicitly, either by catching them with a try-catch block or declaring them in the method’s throws clause.

When do they occur?
Usually due to external conditions beyond the program’s control, like file not found, network errors, or database issues.

Examples:
IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException

Handling:
You must handle or declare them, otherwise, the code won’t compile.

Unchecked Exceptions:
Definition:
These are exceptions that the compiler does not force you to handle. They are subclasses of RuntimeException.

When do they occur?
Usually due to programming errors such as logic mistakes or improper use of APIs.

Examples:
NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException

Handling:
You can choose to handle them, but it’s not mandatory.

Summary Table:
Feature	Checked Exceptions	Unchecked Exceptions
Checked by compiler?	Yes	No
Subclass of	Exception (excluding RuntimeException)	RuntimeException
Handling mandatory?	Yes	No
Common use case	External errors (IO, DB, etc.)	Programming errors
In short: Checked exceptions represent conditions outside the program’s control that must be handled, while unchecked exceptions represent programming bugs.

Would you like me to give examples or explain how to create custom exceptions?

what is constructor and what is its use
ChatGPT said:
Interviewer: What is a constructor and what is its use in Java?

Me (as interviewee):
A constructor in Java is a special method that is called automatically when an object of a class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the new object.

Key points about constructors:
The constructor has the same name as the class.

It does not have a return type, not even void.

If you do not provide a constructor, Java provides a default no-argument constructor.

You can overload constructors by defining multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

Constructors are used to set initial values for object attributes or perform any setup required at object creation.

Example:
public class Car {
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
}
Usage:

Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
Here, the constructor initializes the model and year fields when the Car object is created.

Summary:
Constructor initializes objects.

Automatically invoked during object creation.

Helps in setting up initial state.

Would you like me to explain default constructors versus parameterized constructors?

4. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList ?
ChatGPT said:
Interviewer: What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java?

Me (as interviewee):
Sure! Both ArrayList and LinkedList implement the List interface, but they differ significantly in their underlying data structures and performance characteristics:

1. Underlying Data Structure:
ArrayList:
Uses a dynamic array internally to store elements.

LinkedList:
Uses a doubly linked list, where each element (node) holds references to the previous and next nodes.

2. Performance:
Operation	ArrayList	LinkedList
Access by index	Fast (O(1)) – direct access to elements by index	Slow (O(n)) – must traverse from start to reach index
Insertion/removal at end	Fast amortized O(1) (may need resizing)	Fast O(1) – just adjust pointers
Insertion/removal in middle	Slow O(n) – shifting elements	Faster O(1) – just adjust pointers once position is found
Memory overhead	Less memory (stores only data)	More memory (stores data + two references per node)
3. Use Cases:
Use ArrayList when you need fast random access and mostly add/remove elements at the end.

Use LinkedList when you frequently add/remove elements in the middle or at both ends, and random access is less frequent.

Summary:
Feature	ArrayList	LinkedList
Data structure	Dynamic array	Doubly linked list
Index-based access	Fast (O(1))	Slow (O(n))
Insertion/removal	Slow in middle (O(n))	Fast at ends or middle (O(1))
Memory usage	Lower	Higher (due to node pointers)
Would you like me to provide code examples or talk about thread-safe versions like CopyOnWriteArrayList?

What is the internal working of JVM ?
ChatGPT said:
Interviewer: What is the internal working of JVM?

Me (as interviewee):
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the core component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that enables Java’s platform independence by executing Java bytecode.

Here’s an overview of its internal working:

1. Class Loader Subsystem:
Responsible for loading class files (.class) into memory.

It reads the bytecode from files, networks, or other sources.

Performs verification to ensure the bytecode is valid and safe to execute.

Loads classes in a hierarchical manner — bootstrap loader, extension loader, and application loader.

2. Runtime Data Areas:
When a class is loaded, JVM allocates memory in these areas:

Method Area (or Metaspace): Stores class-level data — class structure, method code, static variables, constants.

Heap: Stores all Java objects and arrays.

Java Stack: Stores frames for method calls, including local variables and partial results. Each thread has its own stack.

Program Counter (PC) Register: Contains the address of the JVM instruction currently being executed for each thread.

Native Method Stack: Used for native (non-Java) method calls.

3. Execution Engine:
Interpreter: Reads bytecode instructions one by one and executes them.

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler: Improves performance by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime, so subsequent executions are faster.

Garbage Collector (GC): Manages automatic memory cleanup by freeing memory of objects no longer in use.

4. Native Interface:
Allows JVM to interact with native applications and libraries written in other languages like C or C++.

Summary:
JVM loads, verifies, and executes Java bytecode.

It manages memory with different runtime data areas.

Uses both interpreter and JIT compiler for execution.

Handles garbage collection automatically.

Ensures platform independence by abstracting the underlying OS and hardware.

Would you like me to explain how class loading or JIT compilation works in more detail?

java is compiled or interpreted
ChatGPT said:
Interviewer: Is Java compiled or interpreted?

Me (as interviewee):
Java is both compiled and interpreted, which is one of its key strengths.

Here’s how it works:

Compilation:
Java source code (.java files) is first compiled by the Java compiler (javac) into bytecode (.class files). Bytecode is a platform-independent, intermediate representation.

Interpretation:
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) then interprets this bytecode at runtime, translating it into machine code that can run on the specific hardware and operating system.

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:
To improve performance, JVM uses a JIT compiler that compiles frequently executed bytecode sequences into native machine code just in time, so they run faster on subsequent executions.

Summary:
Java source → compiled to bytecode (platform-independent).

Bytecode → interpreted or JIT-compiled by JVM at runtime.

This hybrid approach gives Java platform independence plus better performance than pure interpretation.

Would you like me to explain how JIT compilation improves performance?

What are new features of interface after Java 8 ?
ChatGPT said:
Interviewer: What are the new features of interfaces introduced after Java 8?

Me (as interviewee):
After Java 8, interfaces in Java gained some powerful new features to support functional programming and improve backward compatibility. The key features are:

1. Default Methods:
Interfaces can have default method implementations using the default keyword.

This allows adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

Example:

interface MyInterface {
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}
2. Static Methods:
Interfaces can include static methods with implementations.

These methods belong to the interface itself and can be called without an instance.

Example:

interface MyInterface {
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method in interface.");
    }
}
3. Private Methods (Java 9 and later):
Interfaces can have private methods to share code between default and static methods.

Private methods help reduce duplication inside interfaces but are not accessible outside.

Summary:
Feature	Description	Since Version
Default Methods	Methods with default implementation in interface	Java 8
Static Methods	Static methods inside interfaces	Java 8
Private Methods	Private helper methods inside interfaces	Java 9
These features make interfaces more powerful and flexible, especially for API evolution and functional-style programming.
